# Solana Memecoin Bot — Sprint Completion Report

## MVP Achievements (Free/Public Jupiter API Tier)

### ✅ Reliable End-to-End Live Trading Pipeline
- Wallet, config, and key rotation robustly initialized
- Handles all Jupiter API rate limits with exponential backoff and aggressive cooldown
- Manual trade trigger (`force_trade.txt`) works for MVP validation
- Never crashes on rate limit or wallet/config errors

### ✅ Observability and Logging
- Logs all polling, cooldown, and retry events
- Logs manual trade trigger detection and trade attempts
- All error/cooldown/trigger paths observable in logs

### ✅ Documentation and Maintainability
- README updated with:
  - Known limitations (rate limits, cooldowns, manual trigger workflow)
  - How to force a trade
- Code comments added for all critical logic

### ✅ Testing
- Integration/unit tests run and pass for cooldown, backoff, and manual trigger logic
- Demo log or screen recording available for stakeholders

## Known Limitations
- **Jupiter API free tier severely rate-limited** (429 errors, long cooldowns)
- **No API key:** Cannot increase rate limit without $200/mo subscription
- **Manual trade trigger is the best method for MVP/live validation**
- **Notifications (Discord) may fail due to network/webhook config**

---

## How to Force a Trade (MVP Validation)
1. Create a file named `force_trade.txt` in the project root (can be empty or contain any text)
2. The bot will detect this file before the next trade attempt and force a trade, bypassing cooldowns
3. File is deleted after detection and trade attempt

## Sprint Completion Checklist
- [x] Bot runs end-to-end, never crashes, and handles all errors gracefully
- [x] Manual trade trigger works and is observable in logs
- [x] Cooldown, backoff, and polling logic are robust and observable
- [x] README and code comments are up to date
- [x] Tests run and pass
- [x] Demo log or screen recording available (optional, for stakeholders)

---

## Next Steps (Post-Sprint)
- Consider integrating fallback quote sources (Orca, Raydium, etc.) for more resilience
- Monitor for any new rate limiting patterns and tune intervals as needed
- If Jupiter API key becomes affordable/available, integrate for improved performance

**This report documents the completion of the MVP sprint for the Solana Memecoin Bot, with all core objectives achieved given public API constraints.**
